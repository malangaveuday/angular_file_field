angular_file_field

Angular doesn't provide binding to input type file so to solve this problem we can use this.

How to use it :-

1) Add 'angular.fileField' to your module.

2) Add to container like shown in demo.

3) Add $scope.fileName = '' to your controller.

4) Assign this ng-modal value to your view to show selected file name.
